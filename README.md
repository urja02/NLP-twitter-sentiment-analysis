Analyze the sentiment of the tweets of the Sentiment140 dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline involving the use of 2 classifiers (SVM, Bernoulli Naive Bayes)along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

Evaluvated the classifier using a confusion matrix and roc-auc curve.
